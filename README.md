This was a project that introduced me to the fundamentals of javascript which included functions, methods, objects, loops, conditionals and etc. While working on this project I leared about the fundamentals and how the javascript elements can be used to change or reference html elements, what was challenging about this project was understanding functions and how specific and detailed you have to be when giving them instructions and also how conditionals work with them.
